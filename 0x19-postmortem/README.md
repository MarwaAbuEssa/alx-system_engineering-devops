# VoIP Service Outage - Postmortem Report
## Issue Summary:

**Start Time:**  Friday, 2024-02-16 at 20:15 PST
**End Time:**  Saturday, 2024-02-17 at 03:00 PST
**Duration:**  6 hours 45 minutes
**Impact:**  85% of users experienced a complete outage of voice calling functionality. The remaining 15% faced degraded call quality with dropped calls and choppy audio.
Root Cause: Hardware failure in a core routing switch within our regional data center.

## Timeline:

**20:15 PST:** Internal monitoring systems detect a significant increase in voice call failures and latency.
**20:20 PST:** The Network Operations team receives the first customer reports of call issues.
**20:25 PST:** Initial investigation focuses on software bugs and configuration errors, as hardware failures are considered less likely.
**21:00 PST:** The Team escalates the issue to senior engineers and data center personnel.
**21:30 PST:** Physical inspection of hardware at the data center reveals critical routing switch malfunction.
**22:00 PST:** Emergency failover procedures initiated, routing traffic through backup infrastructure.
**01:00 PST:** Backup infrastructure reaches capacity, leading to partial service restoration for 15% of users.
**02:00 PST:** Replacement switch arrives and installation begins.
**03:00 PST:** New switch operational, full service restored.
Root Cause and Resolution:

The outage was caused by a sudden hardware failure in a critical routing switch within our regional data center. This switch handled a significant portion of voice call traffic, and its failure led to network congestion and communication disruptions.

The issue was resolved by replacing the faulty switch with a new unit. Backup infrastructure was insufficient to handle the full load of voice traffic, resulting in a partial service restoration for a segment of users until the new switch was operational.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures:

Implement redundant critical network equipment: Invest in redundant hardware for core infrastructure components to ensure seamless failover in case of individual unit failures.
Enhance monitoring and alerting systems: Improve real-time monitoring capabilities to detect hardware issues promptly, allowing for faster response times.
Regular hardware maintenance: Implement preventative maintenance schedules for critical hardware to identify and address potential issues before they cause outages.
Develop comprehensive disaster recovery plans: Refine disaster recovery procedures to ensure efficient service restoration in case of hardware failures or other unforeseen events.
Increase communication transparency: Improve communication channels to inform customers about service disruptions promptly and transparently, providing updates and estimated restoration times.

## Conclusion:

While this outage caused significant disruption for our users, it provided valuable insights into potential vulnerabilities within our infrastructure. By implementing the corrective and preventative measures outlined above, we aim to strengthen our systems and minimize the risk of similar incidents occurring in the future. We are committed to providing reliable and high-quality VoIP services to our customers and appreciate their patience and understanding during this event.
